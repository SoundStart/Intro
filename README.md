Intro
=====
We welcome everyone with open hands. We are currently loosing our minds and trying to figure out how to make this work properly. 
this company was created to give established and upcoming artist an outlet. Providing a platform that they only wish for.
I want to properly introduce my self as its only right to start everything the right way. I am currently a student at Queens university
studying "Business and economics". My knowledge on coding is close to none. I have always been a big fan, i admire people who can
code and make something out of nothing, that siad, I still try to keep with everything that is happening within the coding 
community and participate in regular discussions across forums. 
What we are looking for from you guys. We need to build a rough wireframe of spotify. Website loadout and technical services,
playback features, etc...
Basically we need a spotify clone.
Please get back to us as we are basement startup, that is pushing nearly 50 hours a week trying to design and come up with solutions to
music industry problems and give musicans not only an outlet by a job as well. 
Looking For Coders To Help Us Build Platform
